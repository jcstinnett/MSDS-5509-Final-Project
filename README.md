# MSDS-5509-Final-Project
Final supervised learning project for MSDS course 5509.

This project uses supervised learning techniques to predict running pace based on personal Garmin activity data. 
The goal is to determine which factors best predict avgSpeedMinMile using machine learning models.

## Data
The data was obtained through a request to Garmin for my personal data. Sensitive data (my location) was removed prior to analysis.

## Future Improvements
Improvements to this would include incorporating weather conditions and/or experimenting with additional models.
